<hr>
<p>Currently, there are already two economics plugin with their independent databases. Many would ask:<br>
<blockquote>Why do we need another economic plugin?</blockquote><br>
The answer, of course, is that it is better. But how is it better?</p>

<p>In the new Zekkou Cake update of PocketMine-MP, the rewritten code has become much more object-oriented and there is much less of the so-called "undefined behaviour". This means, it is much easier to track bugs and know what you are doing. At the same time, we are planning to develop xEcon for this new version of PocketMine-MP because xEcon is also a very systematic and "neat" piece of plugin.</p>

<p>xEcon is a plugin that keeps track of transactions. It rarely lets players get or lose money without keeping a record of it. As a result, transactions are always clear with xEcon.<br>
Moreover, it breaks the traditional practice of storing data with the unit of a player, then add cash and bank money as individual things. Instead, it allows anything to be an "economic entity", which refers to anything that can have own accounts. For example, in real life, governments have their bank accounts. Companies also have their bank accounts. These accounts are registered with the owner as the organization/company, not the leader of it. In xEcon's world, it is the same. PocketFactions is a good example. Every faction has its own accounts.<br>
Furthermore, xEcon, as is the core, doesn't require every entity to have an account called "cash" and another one called "bank" and a config value called "debt". Instead, it is very flexible. One can always declare a new entity type that has none of these accounts. They only have to classify an account as either "capital" or "liability". And as the most important advantage, the data of each entity is saved in a separate file. As a result, only active entities (e.g. online players) are loaded in memory. This greatly resolves the memory exhaustion issue in many large servers.</p>

<p>xEcon is the revolution of economic plugins. It is the best choice for servers and developers if they want a systematic system of economy. In fact, the reason why PocketMine-MP is rewritten in the Zekkou Cake update is exactly why xEcon should be used.</p>
